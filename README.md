Setup (as tested on MacOS)
---------------------------

1. Install Python 3 from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/) (or use brew/apt/pyenv)

2. Run `make init` (this will install pip packages, use virtualenv or something similar if you don't want to install globally)

3. Run `make` to run the game. Run `DEBUG=True make` to see rects and coords

4. Use <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key to play and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the game.

5. Optionally run `make web` to run the game in the browser (`pygbag`).
